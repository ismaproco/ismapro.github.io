This is the repository of my Personal Portfolio.
--------------

It was created as a project for the nanodegree course in udacity, and I decided to keep it as my personal portfolio page.

The URL to see it live are:

http://ismapro.co
http://ismapro.github.io

It is using Vanilla Javascript with object definition to dinamically add content to the portfolio.
